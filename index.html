<h3>Sports</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Dance:</strong> I have been dancing all my life since I was three years old. Dancing is my life and it just expresses my feelings so well. My least favorite styles are tap and acro. And my favorite styles are jazz and contemporary.</li>
  <li><strong>Cheer:</strong> I have been doing cheer for almost three years. I love to cheer because it feels great to make people smile. I love to show spirit by wearing the uniforms and the bows. I am now a cheer captain and it is very challenging but I love it.</li>
